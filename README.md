# 🏠 House Price Prediction

**Project Type:** Data Preprocessing & Regression Modeling  
**Source:** [Kaggle - House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data)

---

## 🎯 Objective

Prepare the Ames Housing dataset for regression modeling by applying:
- ✅ Data cleaning & missing value imputation  
- ✅ Label Encoding for categorical features  
- ✅ Log transformation of the target variable (`SalePrice`)  
- ✅ Train/test splitting and evaluation using RMSE

## ⚙️ Features Processed

- 🔍 Imputed missing values (median for numerics, "Missing" for categoricals)
- 🔁 Combined train & test before encoding to handle unseen labels
- 🔢 Applied `LabelEncoder` for all categorical features
- 🔄 Performed `log1p()` transformation on `SalePrice`
- 🧪 Split data into training and validation sets

## 📊 Libraries Used

- `pandas` — Data manipulation  
- `numpy` — Numerical operations  
- `matplotlib` & `seaborn` — Visualizations  
- `scikit-learn` — Preprocessing, modeling, evaluation

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

1. ✅ **Install Required Libraries**
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
   ```

2. 📂 **Download and Unzip the Project Folder**

   Make sure the folder structure looks like this:
   ```
   house-price-prediction/
   ├── house_price_preprocessing.ipynb
   └── data/
       ├── train.csv
       └── test.csv
   ```

3. 🧠 **Run the Notebook**

   - Open `house_price_preprocessing.ipynb` in **Jupyter Notebook** or **VS Code**
   - Run all cells sequentially to execute data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation

4. 📄 **Generate Predictions**

   After running all cells, a file named `submission.csv` will be generated:
   ```
   submission.csv
   ```
   This file is ready for **Kaggle submission**.
